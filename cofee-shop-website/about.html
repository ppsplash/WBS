        Indian filter coffee is a coffee drink made by mixing hot milk and sugar
        with the infusion obtained by percolation brewing of finely ground
        coffee powder with chicory in a traditional Indian filter. It has been
        described as "hot, strong, sweet and topped with bubbly froth" and is
        known as filter kaapi in India.

        Traditionally, Indian filter coffee is made with Plantation A washed
        arabica or Peaberry coffee beans. The beans are dark roasted, ground,
        and blended with chicory, with the coffee constituting 80-90% and the
        chicory 10-20% of the mixture. The chicory's slight bitterness
        contributes to the flavor of Indian filter coffee.

        Indian filter coffee is prepared by first bringing water to a boil. A
        special cylindrical filter is used in the preparation of the coffee. The
        filter has two metal cups that assemble one over the other. The filter
        coffee powder is first added to the upper cup on top of the perforated
        chamber and then compressed with a pressing disc.

        The boiled water is then poured over the disc and filter. The upper cup
        is then secured with the lid, and the coffee is allowed to brew. This
        process allows the water to extract more flavor from the coffee,
        resulting in a more robust and stronger flavor compared to Western drip
        coffee. Once the collector containing the brew is detached, the brew can
        be combined with hot milk. Sugar may also be added to the filter coffee.
